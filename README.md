# Egg-Drop
SenseHat Egg Drop Game

![](Images/egg.png)

Egg Drop is a simple game where eggs fall from for the top of the SenseHat.  The egg falls toward the ground under the influence of gravity!  You have a basket which you can use to catch the eggs.  If you catch one, then you gain one point and your score goes up.  You also now have the chance to play the next round.  A new egg now drops from a random position at the top of the SenseHat.  To control your basket, tilt your SenseHat left or right which will measure the change in the axis and move the basket.

However, if you miss the egg then the it’s ‘Game Over’ and you have to start again.
